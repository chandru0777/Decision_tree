#  Smart Study Hour Predictor

This project is a **Machine Learning web application** built using **Flask** that predicts whether a student will **pass or fail** based on their study habits, sleep hours, previous exam score, and distraction level.  
It uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** for prediction.

---

##  Features
- Predicts **Pass/Fail** results based on input data.
- Simple **Flask web interface** with a **light-themed CSS**.
- Trained using a **custom dataset**.
- Easy to modify and retrain with new data.

##  Dataset
**`study_data.csv`** contains the following columns:
- `study_hours` → Hours spent studying daily.
- `sleep_hours` → Hours of sleep per day.
- `previous_score` → Previous exam score (out of 100).
- `distraction_level` → Distraction scale (1-10).
- `passed` → `1` for pass, `0` for fail.

Example:
```csv
study_hours,sleep_hours,previous_score,distraction_level,passed
5,7,65,3,1
6,8,70,2,1
3,5,50,7,0
```
